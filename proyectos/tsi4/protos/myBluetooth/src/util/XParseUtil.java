 *What does Xparse-J do?

 * Xparse-J reads XML documents from a given string and presents the resulting document as a tree structure comprised
 * of com.exploringxml.xml.Node and com.exploringxml.xml.JSArray. Both Node and JSArray have basic functionality for
 * navigating the document tree and accessing its data.
 * All character encodings that are supported by Java can be processed.
